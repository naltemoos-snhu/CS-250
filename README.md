How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret users needs by imagining myself in their shoes and what they would want from the system as well as focus grouping ideas. We implement them by using user stories and using those to keep in mind how we should be proceeding with the design.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach design programs by defining the problems that need to be solved, designing the solution, testing the solution and again. I hope to incorparate scrum in general and CI/CD because I feel that it helps work flow and quality control by using iterations and time blocking for focus.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
